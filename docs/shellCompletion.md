`pyparam` supports shell completions for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`. It also supports the script to be ran as a python script (in the format of `python myscript.py`) and as a python module (in the format of `python -m myscript`).

To enable the completions, you will have to print the code generated by `params.shellcode(...)`, and let the user save it at required locations for the shell to initiate the completion.

`params.shellcode` has 3 arguments that generates codes for direct executables, python scripts and python modules.

- Argument `shell`: Specifies the shell (One of `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`)
- Argument `python`: Once specified, program will be ran as a python script or a module.
  It specifies the path or name to the python you used to run your script or your module.
  For example, if your python executable is `python3.8`, you will need to specify `python3.8`.
  In this case, your program name has to be the path to `myscript.py`, for example.
- Argument `module`: Whether the program is running as a python module.
  `python` will be used if specified and your program name need to be the name of the module (`myscript`, for example).

Let's say you have `$ myscript shellcode` calling `params.shellcode(...)` and printing the code:

## Completions for bash
```sh
$ myscript shellcode >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Completions for fish
For direct executable:
```sh
$ myscript shellcode >> ~/.config/fish/completions/myscript.fish
```
For python script or module:
```sh
$ myscript shellcode >> ~/.config/fish/completions/python.fish
$ #     corresponding to your python executable:   ^^^^^^
```

## Completions for zsh
```sh
$ myscript shellcode >> ~/.zshrc
```

If you encounter `command not found: compdef`, make sure you have this before the inserted code:
```zsh
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

## Enabling completion in your script

Make sure you call `params.parse(...)` after all parameters/commands defined to make those shell code work.
